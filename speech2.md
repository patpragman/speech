Hi everybody, so for those of you graduating, "we made it!"  Congratulations!  I think we should take a bit of a moment and consider how big of an achievement it is to just make it through.  School is shockingly hard.  It's way harder than "real work."  I have had a lot of jobs, none of them have really been as challenging as grad school, while in a real job you can usually leave your work at work, in grad school you basically live your project the entire time.  The deadlines and the projects, especially in the engineering field or for folks like me doing interdisciplinary stuff are simply exhausting.  The work is intellectually rigorous, and it does require sacrifice.  Not "bad exhausting," but yeah - exhausting.  Not "bad sacrifice" but yeah, sacrifice.  I loved the research I did and there were times when even I was just mentally and emotionally drained after a day working on it.  I feel like before I go on, I want to just take a minute to acknowledge the efforts of the graduating class, the efforts of the professors to support us, our friends and family, and all of the people who helped us along the way.  Make no mistake, while some of us have more support than others, ultimately, none of us could have done this alone.  There are a lot of people to thank, so rather than go through and thank the 4 dozen or so people I owe for my success, I think we should give our support networks a round of applause and just remember, when we get the time, to be grateful for those who helped.  <hold for applause>

When I started working on this speech, I was torn.  First, part of me didn't really want to do it at all.  I'm just really tired.  But the hell with it - what's one final project presentation among all the work so far.  The other thing I was worried about was that nobody would really care, my story isn't really unique and at times it's kind of a bummer.  Why should you care about what I have to say over someone else?  Why should you watch some bearded middle-aged dude rant at the end of the semester?  Well, things have been rough for the last little bit, and I hope that my story can be somewhat motivational to you guys as you go off into the world and kick ass.

For those of you who don't know my story, I have multiple sclerosis, it ruined my vision and ended my previous career.  I underwent a second big treatment for that in January of this year and it kind of wiped me out for a bit at the beginning of the semester.  I even attended my first class this semester over zoom because I was getting an intravenous dose of medication during the time class was scheduled.  This year and last year I started the semester being somewhat unsure if I would be able to finish it.  I figured I'd either be dead or too tired to do well in class and be forced to give up.  Indeed, I've often wanted to quit.  The doctors assured me that the probability of major issues was "really not that bad" and that it was unlikely that treatment would kill me.  Still, they followed that up by listing off a dictionary of horendous possible side-effects; maybe it wouldn't kill me, but I might wish I was dead afterwards.  It was hard to believe this was happening and in my mind I started both this year and the previous year with the feeling that I was a condemned man - just waiting for my execution (or worse).  If all that wasn't enough, I slipped and fell on the ice and tore a tendon in my leg in March and had to defend my thesis shortly after surgery to fix it.  The last few months have been hard.

Then there's the academic stuff.  

I never have been very formal, so learning to write formally has been an unexpected part of my training in computer vision.  Seriously, I have consistently struggled with this for the last year.  Graduate students are being enculturated into academia when we get a masters; that process has been more challenging for me than I'd care to admit.  I'm rough around the edges.  I know that, and I've taken great pride in that in my life.  I worked in and out of bush Alaska in my old life.  I have been covered in grease and moose blood on the same day.  Agonizing over the placement of paragraphs or the appropriate verb tense was unbelievably challenging for me.  Not that it wasn't important, but forcing myself see the value in it was hard.  And there was value in it, the work I have done is meaningful.  The thesis was way harder than any of the research for me, if there's anyone here who hasn't graduated yet, I promise you - if I can do it you can too.  

People ask me why I went back to school, and I say "to reinvent my self" or "to get a job."  But that's only partially true.  I went back to school to give me something to do while I underwent treatment.  I went back to school to grieve and to grow and to find a new purpose when my vocation was stolen from me.  I'm not legally blind, still, my vision is damaged enough such that I no longer drive, and simple things like seeing the white board or low-contrast text can be a real struggle.  I find myself squinting all the damn time now.  The entire time I've been in school I've been slightly improving - but it certainly hasn't happened as fast as I would have liked.  Along the way, school didn't just give me something to do - I reevaluated what is important in my life.  I reevaluated what I wanted to do with my life.  For this, I need to thank the university (despite the ongoing union disagreements) - I am a changed man.  Today, here in front of all you people, I begrudgingly acknowledge that while I am not as capable as I once was, I am still able to make a difference.  I stand defiantly and declare "I got this!  Never give up!"  I hereby cast off the baggage of my old life and move forward to solve problems in an uncertain future.

Because really, what I found I loved in this process was figuring out how to do something, then doing it.  This place taught me that real big problems out in that wide world aren't insurmountable - I can solve them.  We can solve them.  Indeed, they can provide a meaning to your life unto themself.  Graduates, we did not just learn how to do math, write code, or design "stuff."  We learned how to overcome obstacles and tackle complex challenges.  There are certainly plenty of those.  Turn on the news, look at your phone, just look around town.  Our world right now is practically overrun with problems and many of them feel overwhelming, I know.  Well, pick one that you care about.  Even a small one.  And solve it.  Apply these skills you've learned!  There are so many new tools being created every day.  I can't even keep up with all of them.  Jump in to the deep end, and let's use these tools for good!  Ask yourself, what kind of world do I want to live in?  Then let's make that world a reality.  We have that power - us, right here in this room, we are - frankly - a collection of capable and creative badasses.  We should not forget that as we move forward from here.  The skills we have learned in the last few years will allow us to succeed at anything we set our minds to.  We just have to set our minds. 

So, before I go, let’s not just reflect on the hard work and the struggles we’ve overcome to reach this moment. Let’s also look forward to the incredible potential each of us holds. We’ve not only survived school; we’ve thrived under pressure and emerged stronger.  We are ready to tackle the world’s challenges. Today is not a chapter closing in our lives, this is the exciting beginning of whatever comes next. Embrace this uncertainty, lean into these difficulties, and use your skills to forge paths where none seem to exist. Congratulations, graduates! We made it - now let's stop dreaming about change and start engineering it.  But first, let's maybe go get some beers.
